  Books have many characters and
  characters are in many books in a series.

  How do we accomplish this complex association?
  With a join table between Characters and Books.

  This join table (let's call it character_books) will just
  have -in addition to its primary key- two foreign key
  columns for the character and book ids.
  Each row in this join table acts as a relation
  between a book and a character.


  #So I think we're looking for the author's name and the subgenres names
